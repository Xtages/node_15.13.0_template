This is simple Node.js + Express app.

# **myapp**

## Getting Started

Run your app in the development mode.

```
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

[Xtages](https://console.xtages.com) expects the app's entrypoint to be in [`src/server.js`](https://docs.xtages.com/projects/deployments/#nodejs--express) and to serve content on port 3000, otherwise the server will fail to start.

## Tests

Runs your tests using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

```
npm test
```
